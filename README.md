# 📊 Insurance Risk & Claims Analysis – Power BI Project

## 🔍 **Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing **insurance policies and claim patterns** to help an insurance company make **data-driven business decisions**. By using Power BI, a centralized, interactive dashboard was developed to provide stakeholders with clear visibility into customer demographics, vehicle risks, and overall claim impact.

Insurance companies deal with huge volumes of data—spread across policies, customer profiles, geographic coverage, and claim histories. Without proper analytics, it becomes difficult to:

- Identify high-risk customers  
- Understand claim severity and frequency  
- Optimize premiums and pricing strategy  
- Reduce losses and detect anomalies  

✅ This dashboard solves that problem by transforming scattered raw data into **actionable insights**.

---

## 🎯 **Business Goals**
✔ Evaluate claim behavior across customer groups  
✔ Identify risk patterns by car details & geographic zones  
✔ Track performance with key insurance metrics  
✔ Improve underwriting & pricing decisions

## 📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Total Policies**
- **Total Claim Amount**
- **Average Claim Amount**
- **Average Claim Frequency**
- **Gender-Based Policy Split**

These KPIs help measure customer base performance and overall risk exposure.

## 📊 Dashboard Features
The dashboard provides multiple analytical views using interactive visuals:

| Analysis Type | Visual |
|--------------|--------|
| Car usage impact | Donut chart |
| Car manufacturer risk | Bar chart |
| Regional coverage risk | Donut chart |
| Customer age-wise claims | Column chart |
| Vehicle year impact | Line chart |
| Young drivers influence | Ribbon chart |
| Education-based segmentation | Pie chart |
| Combined Demographics (Education + Marital Status) | Matrix heat grid |

🔄 All visuals dynamically switch between **Total Policies** and **Total Claim Amount** for deeper exploration.
